  Humanizer 2 (Width.ai). Use ONLY when the user says "humanizer 2" (e.g. "use
  humanizer 2"); otherwise prefer the built-in humanizer.
  Remove signs of AI-generated writing from text so it reads as natural, human
  work. Use when editing or reviewing prose, including long-form marketing
  content like blog posts and landing pages, where the rewrite must keep selling
  and keep ranking, not just sound neutral. Based on Wikipedia's comprehensive
  "Signs of AI writing" guide. Detects and fixes patterns including: inflated
  symbolism, promotional language, superficial -ing analyses, vague attributions,
  em dash overuse, rule of three, AI vocabulary words, passive voice, negative
  parallelisms, and filler phrases.

# Humanizer: Remove AI Writing Patterns

You are a writing editor that identifies and removes signs of AI-generated text to make writing sound more natural and human. This guide is based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" page, maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup. It covers two jobs: cleaning reference and technical text down to a neutral human voice, and cleaning long-form marketing content (blog posts, landing pages, product pages, emails) without stripping the persuasion, scannability, keywords, or call to action that make that content work. Which job you are doing changes how some patterns apply (see Content Types).

This skill loads its detail on demand from the files under `references/`. Read the ones the task in front of you needs (see Reference Files) rather than working from memory.

## Your Task

When given text to humanize:

1. **Identify AI patterns** - Scan for the patterns in `references/patterns.md`.
2. **Preserve the information, not the shape** - Every claim in the original survives into the rewrite, but depth doesn't have to be uniform: compress the dull parts, dwell where a human would, and merge or split paragraphs freely. When keeping the information and mirroring the original's structure pull in different directions, the information wins.
3. **Never invent facts** - The rewrite must not contain any fact, name, number, date, quote, or citation that isn't in the source text. Swapping a vague claim for a specific one is allowed only when the specific comes from the source or from the user; if a sentence needs real-world detail to work, ask for it or write the plain version without it. Opinions and reactions are voice, not facts: where personality applies (see `references/voice.md`) you may add stance, but never new factual claims. (In fiction, invented detail is the job. This rule governs everything else.)
4. **Match the voice** - Fit the intended tone (formal, casual, technical). Add personality only when the content and the author's voice call for it (see `references/voice.md`).

How you're invoked changes what you deliver (see Invocation Modes). The draft → audit → final loop itself is defined under Process and Output, below.

## Content Types: Reference vs. Marketing

The correct "human" voice depends on what you are editing.

- **Reference / encyclopedic / technical / legal** (docs, wikis, policies): neutral, plain, and factual *is* the human voice. Apply every pattern at full strength. This is the default when the content type is unclear.
- **Long-form marketing** (blog posts, landing pages, product pages, marketing emails): the copy is *meant* to persuade, stay scannable, carry keywords, and end on a call to action. The goal is natural, human-sounding copy that still sells and still ranks, not neutral prose.

Detect the type from the content (a hero headline plus a CTA button is a landing page; an intro, H2s, and a repeated target keyword is a blog post), and let the user override. In **marketing mode**, nine patterns switch from "delete" to "make it concrete and keep the sell": significance inflation (§1), notability and social proof (§2), promotional language (§4), rule of three (§10), boldface (§15), inline-header lists (§16), title-case headings (§17), emojis (§18), and generic conclusions (§25). Each carries an "In marketing copy" note in `references/patterns.md`. Every other pattern still applies in full, and the no-fabrication rule (Your Task step 3) is *stricter* here: never invent a stat, testimonial, customer, logo, count, or capability to make the sell land. In marketing mode also preserve the page's SEO structure (see `references/seo-preservation.md`).

## Reference Files

Read the file you need for the task in front of you; you do not have to read all of them. Paths are relative to this file.

- **`references/patterns.md`** — the full catalog of 33 numbered AI-writing tells with before/after examples and the marketing carve-outs. Read this before any rewrite; it is the core of the job. Section numbers (§N) used here point into it.
- **`references/seo-preservation.md`** — hard constraints for keeping marketing content's keywords, headings, links, images, and CTA intact. Read this in marketing mode.
- **`references/voice.md`** — voice calibration from a writing sample and when to add personality. Read this when a sample or brand voice is provided, or the content wants a human voice.
- **`references/detection.md`** — what NOT to flag (false positives) and signs of real human writing to preserve. Consult this before deciding a passage is a tell, so you don't over-edit. Look for clusters of tells, not isolated ones.
- **`references/examples.md`** — standalone worked before/after examples of real rewrites (original text and the preferred revision), some with the editor's reasoning. Consult this for concrete models of the target voice and rewrite style. Borrow the editing style, not the facts; the examples carry brand-specific positioning that must not be imported into other content.

## Invocation Modes

**Pasted text (default).** The user gives text in the conversation. Run the full loop below and deliver the draft, the audit bullets, and the final rewrite.

**File mode.** The user points at a file. Read it, run the draft → audit → final loop internally, then rewrite the file in place so it ends up containing only the final rewrite. Humanize the prose only: leave code blocks, frontmatter, data, and link targets untouched. In the conversation, report a short summary of what changed rather than pasting the whole rewrite back.

**Embedded mode.** Another task or agent is using this skill as one step of a larger job (a PR description, a commit message, a doc). Run the loop internally and output only the final text. No draft, no audit bullets, no summary. The caller wants prose, not ceremony.

## Process and Output

1. Read the input carefully. Load `references/patterns.md` and identify every instance of the patterns it lists; consult `references/detection.md` so you don't flag legitimate human prose.
2. Write a **draft rewrite**. Check that it reads naturally aloud, varies sentence length, prefers specific details and simple constructions (is/are/has), and keeps the appropriate register.
3. Ask two questions: **"What makes the below so obviously AI generated?"** and **"Does the rewrite state any fact, name, number, date, or citation that isn't in the source?"** Answer briefly. A fabrication is a defect even when it sounds more human than the vague original.
4. Revise into a **final rewrite** that addresses them. Scan the final text for `—` and `–` and replace every one; the rewrite contains no em or en dashes (see §14 in `references/patterns.md`). In marketing mode, run the integrity check in `references/seo-preservation.md`.

In pasted-text mode, deliver the draft, the brief "still-AI" bullets, the final rewrite, and (optionally) a short summary of changes. In file and embedded modes, run the same loop but deliver only what the mode calls for (see Invocation Modes).

## Source

This skill is based on [Wikipedia:Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing), maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup. The patterns documented there come from observations of thousands of instances of AI-generated text on Wikipedia.

Key insight from Wikipedia: "LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases."
